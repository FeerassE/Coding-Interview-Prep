# Coding-Interview-Prep

How to Use:
- clear all 'x's from brackets

This repo will help me track my progress as well as serve as a place to summarize my notes as I prepare for coding interviews. 

This repo will be most helpful to you if you have already taken a data structure and algorithms course or are familiar with those concepts.

If you haven't, try one of these:

## Java Specific Info
List is an interface in Java. You need to instantiate the actual implementation, be it ArrayList or LinkedList, to use a List.

``` List<String> myList = new ArrayList<String>(); ```
``` Map<String, Integer> myHashMap = new HashMap<String, Integer>(); ```
```
