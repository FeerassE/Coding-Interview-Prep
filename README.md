# Coding Interview Prep


"When I consider everything that grows<br>
Holds in perfection but a little moment;"

This repo will help me track my progress as well as serve as a place to <br>
summarize my notes as I prepare for coding interviews. 

This repo will be most helpful to you if you have already taken a data <br>
structure and algorithms course or are familiar with those concepts.

If you haven't, try one of these:

## Big O notation
provides an upperbound (worst case)


## Miscellaneous Info
ASCII values:
- lowercase 'a': decimal 97
- uppercase 'A': decimal 65

BitWise Operations:
XOR(^):<br>
1 ^ 1 = 0<br>
0 ^ 0 = 0<br>
1 ^ 0 = 1<br>
0 ^ 1 = 1<br>

a ^ b = c<br>
